# IoT-based-Home-Security-System
IoT- based Home Security System; Implemented by Raspberry pi and Sensor Modules for fire, motion, and voice detection.
Raspberry Pi Operating System: we have installed a Raspberry Pi operating system using Raspberry Pi Imager. Raspberry Pi Imager is a quick and easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS to a microSD card.
To build our security system, we use the following pieces of hardware equipment: Raspberry Pi, USB cable, LED, Buzzer, Breadboard, SD Card and adapter (64GB), Resistor, Jumper wires, PIR Sensors, Camera Pi, Two-Channel DC Relay, Power supply
List of software and operating systems that we have used in our project: Windows 10, MobaXterm, Ubuntu 18.04
Raspberry Pi IP Address: Pinging Raspberry Pi to verify they both in the same network as my laptop. 
Remotely Access to Raspberry Pi: We use the MobaXterm server for remote access to our Raspberry Pi. MobaXterm is the ultimate toolbox for remote computing.
